Load the tool.

    >>> import util.runmask

Next, make a copy of the demo input files so we can modify it without damaging
the original.

    >>> import shutil
    >>> import os
    >>> tmp_dir = "/tmp/test"
    >>> if(os.path.isdir(tmp_dir)):
    ...   shutil.rmtree(tmp_dir)

    >>> shutil.copytree(
    ...   "demo-data/cru-ts40_ar5_rcp85_ncar-ccsm4_toolik_field_station_10x10",
    ...   "/tmp/test"
    ... )
    '/tmp/test'

Show the copy:

    >>> util.runmask.show_mask("/tmp/test/run-mask.nc", 'Just a note')

Before we go any farther, we'll import some more helper libraries that we will
use for demonstration and testing:

    >>> import netCDF4 as nc
    >>> import numpy as np

While we are using `netCDF4` and `numpy` here for testing `runmask_util` was
written so that you should not need these libraries for basic manipulations of
the `dvmdostem` run mask file. Also, the style of programming used here is
geared toward testing - for general use, you are more likely to use the command
line interface from your shell.

Count the number of enabled pixels in the demo file.

    >>> d = nc.Dataset("/tmp/test/run-mask.nc")
    >>> np.count_nonzero(d.variables['run'])
    2
    >>> d.close()

Try clearing out the file with `util.runmask`. 

> This style of programming uses the command line interface, but is designed to
  be "programable" for use in a testing system. Normal use of the command line
  interface would be something like this `$ ./runmask-util.py --help`

    >>> util.runmask.cmdline_run(util.runmask.cmdline_parse(["--reset", "/tmp/test/run-mask.nc"]))
    0

And then check our file again - there should not be any pixels enabled after a
reset.

    >>> d = nc.Dataset("/tmp/test/run-mask.nc")
    >>> np.count_nonzero(d.variables['run'])
    0
    >>> d.close()
