  `DVMDOSTEM` is an advanced process-based terrestrial
  ecosystem model (TEM) designed to study ecosystem responses to climate changes
  and disturbances. It has a particular focus on permafrost regions (i.e. regions
  characterized by soils that stay partially frozen all year round for at
  least two consecutive years), encompassing boreal, arctic, and alpine landscapes.
