The dvm-dos-tem (`dvmdostem`) model is a process based bio-geo-chemical ecosystem 
model that focuses on C and N dynamics as well as soil thermal dynamics in high 
latitude ecosystems.

For complete documentation of the latest release, see the website:

> NOTE: Sept 2022, we are in the process of updating the entire documentation
system. There is still info scattered across this README, the wiki, a Google Doc
and the Sphinx system (published here:
http://ua-snap.github.io/dvm-dos-tem/index.html), but we are working on
consolidating the info into primarily the Sphinx system.

> Whats with the name? `dvm-dos-tem` is short for 
"Dynamic Vegetation \[Model\] Dynamic Organic Soil Terrestrial Ecosystem Model".
Orignally the model was simply "TEM", and as more logic and capabilities have 
been added, the name has grown. We still frequently use simply "TEM" because it 
is less cumbersome for writing and typing.
