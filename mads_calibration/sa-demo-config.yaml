# The following keys (params, pftnums, and percent_diffs) should be lists of
# identical length. I.e. for each parameter we need to specify the PFT and a
# value for the perturbation. The perturbation is expressed as a percentage
# difference, and controls what kind of range is use to draw samples from for 
# the parameter.

# The "perturbations" around the initial parameter values
# percent_diffs: [.1, .1, .1, .1, .1, .1, .1]

# Manually set parameter bounds. This option should be mutually exclusive 
# with percent_diffs. In other words only specify one of percent_diffs or
