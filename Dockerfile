# Dockerfile for dvmdostem project.
#
# Uses a multi-stage build. If you want to only create one of the
# intermediate stages, then run something like:
#
#    $ docker build --target cpp-dev --tag cpp-dev:0.0.1 .
#
#    Note trailing '.' specifying build context as current directory!
#
# If you simply docker build the entire file, or one of the 
# later stages you will end up with several un-named, un-tagged 
# images from the preceeding stages (i.e. <none>:<none> in the output 
# docker image ls). For this reason, it might
# be nicer to build and tag each stage successively,
#

# General dev tools compilers, etc

# Bare bones python approach might be to use system provided python, which in 
# ubuntu focal (20.4) means python3 and pip3, or installing python-is-python3
#RUN apt-get install python3-pip
#RUN apt-get install python-is-python3
#RUN pip install matplotlib numpy pandas bokeh netCDF4 commentjson ipython

# For a more robust version managed python system, use Pyenv.
# Pyenv may be overkill - was trying it in order to help with gdal install
# but never got it to work. Decided to use a separate image with gdal support
# but pyenv might be useful for other packages in the future and is a nice
# unified way to package and version manage our tooling that has been working
# well across macOS, Ubunut, CentOS, etc.

# NOTES #

# Examples of stand alone use. Alternatively it seems you can use 
# docker-compose for a lot of this and avoid having to explcitly specify 
# volumes, etc:
# docker run --rm -it --volume $(pwd):/work dvmdostem-run:0.0.1 bash
# docker run --rm -it --volume $(pwd):/work dvmdostem-run:0.0.1 make
# docker run --rm -it --volume $(pwd):/work dvmdostem-run:0.0.1 /work/dvmdostem --help
#INCATALOG="/Users/tobeycarman/Documents/SEL/dvmdostem-input-catalog"
#docker run -it --rm -p 5006:5006 --volume $(pwd):/work --volume $INCATALOG:/data/dvmdostem-input-catalog dvmdostem-run:0.0.1


# Dockerfile words:
# RUN - is used to install stuff and setup environment
# CMD - only a single CMD per image, default command when starting container, easily overrridden by docker run
# ENTRYPOINT - the CMD is *always* appended to ENTRYPOINT

#Lots of good ideas here:
